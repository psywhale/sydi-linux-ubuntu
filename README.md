Fork of the sydi-linux.py script with ubuntu/debian support

Found a great server documentation script in [SYDI-linux](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sydi/files/sydi-linux/0.1/) but much dissapoint with its lack of Debian/Ubuntu support.

After much searching with no results, decided to make my own.
