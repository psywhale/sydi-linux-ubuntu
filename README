1. What is SYDI?
----------------

SYDI is a project which purpose is to help people in writing
documentation for their networks.

SYDI consists of four different packages. SYDI-Linux which is intended
to document Linux systems. SYDI-Server which is intended to document 
Windows servers and SYDI-SQL which is intended to document MS-SQL
database servers and SYDI-Exchange which is used to document Microsoft
Exchange organizations.

SYDI-Linux is written i Python, the other scripts are written in VBScript.

SYDI's home page can be found here:
http://sydi.sourceforge.net/

SYDI's project page can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sydi/


1.1. Authors
------------

Patrick Ogenstad (patrick.ogenstad@netsafe.se) and Patrik Kullman 
(patrik.kullman@netsafe.se) have created SYDI-Linux. They work 
as Systems Engineers at a small consulting company in Sweden
called Netsafe (http://www.netsafe.se)

1.2. License
------------

SYDI-Linux is licensed under the BSD license.


2. System Requirements
----------------------

Well, Linux. But it's only really been tested with Gentoo.


3. Running SYDI-Linux
---------------------

At the moment there isn't any command line options, you must
run the script as root or be a member of the portage group.

The script will create a file called [hostname].xml

4. What Next?
-------------

The document that SYDI creates is intended to be used as a base for your
server documentation or just for inventory purposes.

4.1. SYDI Html output
---------------------

To use html output you have to use an XSLT processor, at the moment I havn't
written any script for this but it's easy enough.

If you have libxslt you can run:

xsltproc xml/linuxhtml.xsl [hostname].xml > [hostname].html

4.2. SYDI OpenOffice output
---------------------------

You can convert the xml file generated by SYDI-Linux to the OASIS OpenDocument
format which OpenOffice 2.0 uses by default this is however a bit crude at the
moment. By crude I mean that there is a lot of manual work involved and it could
be a bit smoother, but OpenOffice 2.0 is still in beta and I want to get some
feedback before I continue this.

What you need to do is to first create the content.xml file which contains the
meat for the document.

xsltproc xml/linuxOo.xsl [hostname].xml > content.xml

Then you use this file together with the files under xml/openoffice. What you do
is to create a zip file of content.xml and the openoffice files and rename the zip
to odf. The result would be a [hostname].odf which you can open in OpenOffice 2.0 beta.

Or you can just:

zip -r [hostname].odf *

In the openoffice directory if you've placed the content.xml file there.

When you open the file in OpenOffice you should change the text appearing in brackets.

5. I want more!
---------------

Ok, this looks good but I want more! If you have any feature requests
which you want implemented in a future version of SYDI-Linux any
other SYDI packages), you should visit:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=116471&atid=674897

You can add feature requests anonymously but if you register an account
at Sourceforge you will receive an email when the feature request is updated. It
is also easier for me to have someone to contact if I don't understand the
request.


6. Feedback
-----------

In my opinion one of the best things about writing open source stuff
is getting feedback. So please if you have any comments good or bad
please let me know. I am interested in hearing what you think of the
software and how you are using it. So please take your time to send an
email to patrick.ogenstad@netsafe.se or patrik.kullman@netsafe.se. 
You can also post a comment in the forum found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sydi/.

7. Updates
----------

If you want updates you should check the site http://sydi.sourceforge.net/

An other option is to click on the "Notify me on update" link at
http://sydi.sourceforge.net/download.php then you will receive an email
whenever a new version of SYDI-Linux is released.
There are four links, one for each package of SYDI.
